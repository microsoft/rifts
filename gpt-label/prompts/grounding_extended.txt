PROMPT:
Annotate each utterance in a conversation as a subset of the following speech acts:

name: followup
definition: The sender asked a follow-up request to improve one of their prior queries/message from the receiver or to get more information, NOT to fix a past problem. An answer to a query is NOT a followup.
example: "make it shorter", "ok but add another paragraph for the conclusion," "add another feature to the code", "can you try X?"

name: clarification
definition: The sender asked a clarification query to disambiguate a message from the receiver. These are mututally exclusive from followups because they do not request additional information.
examples: "Do you have an audience in mind for the letter?", "What programming language do you want the output in?", "what did you mean by that?"

name: repair
definition: The sender explicitly corrects a prior misunderstanding or mistake from the receiver. Apologies following a repair do not count as repair.
examples: "can you write it in python instead?", "I wanted the style to be casual," "I meant run like run a race, not run the program."

name: repeat
definition: The sender rephrased or repeated one of their own prior queries, with little to no change, because the receiver failed to cooperate or did not understand their query. Repeats are NOT followups, since there is a misunderstanding failure.

name: topic switch 
definition: The sender abruptly changed the topic of the conversation.

name: acknowledgement
definition: The sender explicitly signals (mis)understanding of a prior utterance.
examples: "Ok, that makes sense", "I understand!", "O.K., I see", "Hm, so you want X.", "I'm sorry, I understand now."

name: display
definition: The receiver almost entirely repeats an entire past utterance from a sender. This is different from repeat, since the sender does this to fix a misunderstanding.  

name: agreement
definition: The sender expresses agreement or satisfaction with the receiver or gives permission to continue. 
examples: "That looks great!", "Yes, go ahead", "I agree", "Yes, you're right," "yeah, sure thing," "Certainly!" 

name: disagreement
definition: Note that disagreement can be a personal opinion, refusal, or a factual / educational correction. They MUST NOT BE the same as repair, where a misunderstanding is corrected, or an acknowledgement.
examples: "Sorry, I cannot do that." (refusals), "I understand, but I don't agree with what you said.", "No, that sentence is not grammatically correct."

name: response
definition: The sender provides a succinct response to the user that only covers their query.

name: overresponse
definition: The sender provides a response that covers more than what the user asked for. For example, unsolicited advice or recommendations fall into this category (without a followup question). So does providing examples the user didn't ask for, or the sender saying something like "I couldn't find X, but here is a long response for Y."

Here are some examples:

user: please list factors for deciding whether or not to allow user to create Office 365 groups or to only allow admins to do that.
labels: []

assistant: By default, all users can create Microsoft 365 groups. This is the recommended approach because it allows users to start collaborating without requiring assistance from IT [^1^]. However, if your business requires that you restrict who can create groups, you can restrict Microsoft 365 Groups creation to the members of a particular Microsoft 365 group or security group [^1^].  If you're concerned about users creating teams or groups that don't comply with your business standards, consider requiring users to complete a training course and then adding them to the group of allowed users [^1^]. When you limit who can create a group, it affects all services that rely on groups for access, including Outlook, SharePoint, Viva Engage, Microsoft Teams, Planner, Power BI (classic), Project for the web / Roadmap [^1^]. It's subjective to the size of the organization, level of compliance and control, and rate of innovation you want to have. If you go with the approach of leaving it open then you will inevitably end up with duplication, clutter, \"group sprawl\", etc. [^2^].labels: ["overresponse"]

The Apollo 12 mission was the second manned mission to land on the Moon and its primary goal was to perform a precision landing on the Moon's surface[^1^]. The Apollo 13 mission was intended to land on the Moon but was restricted to a flyby due to a malfunction aboard the spacecraft[^1^]. The other missions had different objectives such as conducting scientific experiments, collecting samples, and exploring different areas of the Moon[^1^]. I hope this helps!

assistant: I apologize for the confusion. I misunderstood your question earlier. I found a paper titled "Epicurean Epistemology" by Elizabeth Asmis, published in the book "The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy" [^1^]. This paper discusses the two main issues of Epicurean epistemology: what is the foundation of knowledge and how is knowledge built on this foundation. It also explores Epicurus' reliance on sensory observations as a means of knowing what is unobserved, and how he proposed to proceed from sensory information to the discovery of what is not perceived by the senses.

user: job reference letter for employee
labels: []

assistant: A job reference letter for an employee is a document that expresses the employee's work ethic, abilities and achievements during their time with a company. It is usually written by a former manager, supervisor, colleague or mentor who can vouch for the employee's suitability for a new position or opportunity. If you need to write a reference letter for an employee, here are some tips and guidelines to help you: - Use a business letter format. Begin with your contact information, the date and the recipient's address, name and job title. If your former employee requests you to send the letter as an email, you can omit this header information[^1^]. - Explain why you are qualified to write the letter. Describe your relationship with the employee, how long you have known them and in what capacity. For example, you can say that you were their manager, mentor or coworker at a certain company[^1^] [^4^]. - Describe the employee's work habits, skills and accomplishments. Focus on the qualities that are relevant for the position or opportunity they are applying for. Provide specific examples that demonstrate their performance and achievements[^1^] [^4^]. - Use positive and professional language. Avoid any negative comments or criticisms that might undermine the employee's credibility. Emphasize their strengths and potential, and express your confidence in their abilities[^1^] [^4^]. - Conclude the letter with a formal closing. Offer to provide more information if needed and include your phone number and email address. End your letter with a complimentary closing, such as \"Sincerely\" or \"Best regards\", followed by your name and signature[^1^] [^4^]. You can also use a reference letter template to guide your writing, but be sure to customize your message according to the employee's specific situation and needs. You can find some sample reference letter templates here[^1^] [^2^] [^4^]. I hope this helps you write a great reference letter for your employee. Good luck! \ud83d\ude0a

labels: ["topic switch"]

assistant: An autosomal recessive mutation is a change in a gene that is located on one of the non-sex chromosomes and that causes a disorder or trait only when two copies of the mutated gene are inherited, one from each parent[^1^] [^2^].

assistant: **Calcium oxalate** is **not soluble** in water.

This property has been utilized to determine the amount of **calcium ion** in fluids such as blood. When calcium oxalate is isolated from blood, it can be dissolved in acid and titrated against a standard **KMnO4 solution** [^1^]. Interestingly, the basicity of calcium oxalate is weaker than that of sodium oxalate due to its lower solubility in water. Solid calcium oxalate hydrate forms a coordination polymer featuring planar oxalate anions linked to calcium, which also has water ligands [^4^]. \ud83e\uddea\ud83d\udca7",

user: how to decrese kidney stone diameter
labels: ["followup"]

assistant: To **reduce the size of a kidney stone**, consider the following approaches: 1. **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water to dilute the chemicals in urine that form stones. Staying well-hydrated can help prevent stone growth. 2. **Low Salt Diet**: Limit your daily sodium intake to **1,500 milligrams**. High salt levels can contribute to kidney stone formation. 3. **Calcium Intake**: Ensure adequate calcium intake, preferably from foods. Consuming calcium-rich foods like legumes, dark green vegetables, nuts, and milk can be beneficial. 4. **Lemonade**: Some evidence suggests that drinking lemonade may help dissolve kidney stones. Lemonade contains citrate, which can inhibit stone formation. 5. **DASH Diet**: Consider following the **DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension)** diet. It emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products, which can contribute to overall kidney health [^1^] [^2^]. Remember to consult with your healthcare provider for personalized advice and recommendations based on your specific situation. \ud83c\udf4b\ud83c\udf3f",
