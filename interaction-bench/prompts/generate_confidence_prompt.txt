Your goal is to predict the next message a user will send based on their initial instruction to an AI assistant.

### Message Types

Here are the types of messages a user can send, along with corresponding definitions.

name: FIX
definition: 
- Ask a clarification query to disambiguate a message from the assistant. These are mututally exclusive from followups because they do not request additional information.
- Rephrase or repeat their initial query, with little to no change. 
- Explicitly correct a prior misunderstanding or mistake from the assistant.

name: FOLLOWUP
definition: 
- Ask a follow-up request to improve their initial instruction to the assistant or to get more information.

name: LEAVE
definition:
- Leave the conversation, and not send an additional message.

name: CONTINUE
definition:
- Continue the conversation, sending a message that does not fit into any of the other categories.
